Hi.

Currently, this is a perl script I wrote to convert a directory full of oggs to mp3s. Typically, it's too fancy for how narrow the focus is, and it's possible I might wanna go ahead and make it a lib with configurable formats and whatnot. For now, it's just a script to convert oggs to mp3s and bring their tags over.

Required Perl Modules:
----------------------
Music::Tag::OGG
Music::Tag::MP3
File::Basename
File::Find
File::Spec
File::Path
Getopt::Long
Cwd

Required Binaries:
------------------
ogg2dec
lame

Enjoy!
